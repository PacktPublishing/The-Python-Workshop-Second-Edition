## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
s1 = set([1,2,3,4,5,6])
print(s1)
s2 = {1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,6}
print(s2)
s3 = {3,4,5,6,6,6,1,1,2}
print(s3)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for professionals, students, and hobbyists who want to learn Python and apply it to solve challenging real-world problems. Although this is a beginner’s course, you’ll learn more easily if you already have an understanding of standard programming topics like variables, if-else statements, and functions. Experience with another object-oriented program, though not essential, will also be beneficial. If Python is your first attempt at computer programming, this book will help you understand the basics with adequate detail for a motivated student.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-13).
### Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-13 | Python 3.11 | Windows, macOS, or Linux |
| 1-13 | Jupyter notebook | Windows, macOS, or Linux |
